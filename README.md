Project uses the SpeechSynthesisUtterance method. The SpeechSynthesisUtterance interface of the
Web Speech API represents a speech request.
It contains the content the speech service should read and information about how to read it (e.g. language, pitch and volume.)

representing all the available voices on the current device.
